        I am Harish. I recently completed my Mtech Integrated software engineering degree from Vellore Institute of Technology in Chennai. I am excited to begin my career in software engineering, and I have a strong foundation in Java programming. I am a hard worker with a positive attitude and a never-give-up attitude. During my time at VIT, I was able to gain hands-on experience in various programming languages and technologies, and I am eager to apply my skills to real-world projects. Prior to my degree, I completed my schooling at Velammal Matriculation Higher Secondary School in Chennai. Overall, I am passionate about software engineering and eager to learn and grow in this field.
